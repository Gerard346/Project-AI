# Grocery Store AI

Grocery Store AI is an Artificial Intelligence based game made with Unity developed for a university project in CITM UPC (Terrasa, Spain) in our degree in Videogame Developement and Design.

## Information

Grocery Store AI has 3 entities; cashier, client and cleaner that complete their function in a usual grocery store by our own programmed Steering Behaviours and with their own Behaviour Trees to move across, in and out of the store with its corresponding day/night cycle.

### Cashier

Spawn, Paths to his cash and waits till his turn is finished. Then goes home around 10 o'clock at night.

### Client

Spawns when the shop is open, goes to inside the shop, picks an area to pick an object, then wait his turn in the queue to buy the thing he picked, when a spot is clear, he goes in and buys. He stays there a bit with the cashier, waiting his change. After he got the change, he goes home.

### Cleaner

At 12::00 at night he comes to clean the shop, after he cleaned all the shop he goes home.

## Controls

* WASD: Camera Movement
* R: Return camera to initial position
* 2 & Right Click: Will create a parking with cars on the outside of the store increasing the client limit.
